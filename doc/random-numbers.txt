1. Generator

	Since commit 697e84f2d9 (April 2024), bart uses the Philox-4x32-10
	pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) by default.

2. Interaction with the bart looping interface and MPI

	Care has to be taken when using random numbers in a parallel context
	(e.g. by using bart -l, bart -p, or mpi with bart):

	By default, bart will produce reproducible random numbers regardless of
	number of threads or MPI processes used. This means that the output is
	as if the bart command had been called on the entire input, without
	using the loop interface.

	If this behavior is undesirable, it can be changed or even deactivated
	for the loop interface by specifying '--random-dims flags', which will
	vary the random numbers over the dimensions selected by the flags
	argument.

	Note also that reproducibility of random numbers cannot be guaranteed if
	the loop dimensions specified with 'bart -l/-p'	are not the last
	dimensions!
